# hachha.dev

202X attempt at a new personal website. Site compiles into a single executable
w/ embedded content. View it at [hachha.dev](http://hachha.dev)! An
[Atom](https://hachha.dev/blog.feed) feed is available.

## Stack

Site is served with an async runtime powered by actix-web. Templating is powered
by handlebars. Styling is thanks to spectre.css.

Actix-web was chosen over frameworks like dioxus to maximize compatibility.
