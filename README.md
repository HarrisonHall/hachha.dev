# hachha.dev

A personal website that I like to hack around with and occasionally write blogs
posts for. Site compiles into a single executable w/ embedded content. View it
at [hachha.dev](https://hachha.dev)! An [Atom](https://hachha.dev/blog.feed)
feed is available.

## Stack

- Site is served with an async runtime powered by tokio-axum.
- Templating is powered by handlebars.
- Styling uses a modified pico.css.
