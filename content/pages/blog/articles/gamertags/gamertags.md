Gamertags have always fascinated me. They're a form of identity with high
freedom, anonymity, and low consequences. The origin of the modern "gamertag"
likely lies with
[Xbox](https://splicedonline.com/what-was-the-first-gamertag-ever/). They're an
answer to the question "what if people could pick their own names?" While most
platforms now rely on SSO token or emails as the primary identifier for a user,
I hope many will still allow unique usernames.

## Catman

When I was first learning to program in college, I started working on a personal
project to generate images from ascii art. I decided to test it out on some art
I had used in high school for a game project, converting it to ascii and
adjusting the palette. I popped it into
[pyllusrate](https://github.com/HarrisonHall/pyllustrate) and was so proud of
the result it had been my profile ever since. _(Yes, that's a cat...)_

Still, I like variation, so over the years I've created alternatives. I'm lazy,
so the holiday variants tend to overstay their welcome. Sometimes my irl style
leaks through.

## hachha

My own gamertag has changed over the years. It has evolved from `hocko` ->
`HaChHa` -> `hachha`. It's always fun watching someone struggle to figure out to
get my attention for a callout; `hachha` is simply my initials and has no
official pronunciation (I prefer the "ha cha" onomatopoeia, but I hear "ha cha
ha" frequently). For more anonymous settings, I prefer other alternative tags,
but for most platforms "hachha" is fine.
