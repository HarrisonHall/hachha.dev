2023 was **fun**!

## School

I spent over a year working towards a masters in Computer Engineering at Georgia
Tech. Despite taking a single course at a time, and doing the work remotely
(mostly asynchronously), ultimately the work required exceeded my willingness to
continue. Each course was unique, but sadly the tight schedules around
assignment deadlines added unnecessary stress to learning which ultimately
killed my passion for the subject. I'm still interested in some of fields I had
originally intended to study, but I've decided that I'll study them at my own
pace on my own time. Much more thought went into the original pursuit and the
decision to quit than I've expressed here, but it really was a tough decision.

## N3

As originally expected, I failed the N3. I'm not terribly dissapointed. I didn't
have too much time to study directly before it (mostly due to schooling and a
packed November), but I gave it my best shot. As I thought, listening was by far
the most difficult subject. My vocabulary and reading scores were lower than
expected, but both were still passable. My listening score (14/60) was probably
in-line with (if not overestimating) my ability. I'm confident that if I took
the exam again at the end of the year (probably now), I'd pass. With this, and
the fact that I don't really need a certificate for any reason other than ego, I
do not plan to retake the exam.

Instead, I'll be taking the N2! I certainly don't expect to pass at the end of
the year, but I'm going to give it my best shot. I'm caught up to all of N2
grammar on BunPro, so I have 6 months to practice before the December exam.

### Resources

#### Past

- **Japanese From Zero** is a solid beginner resource
- **Genki** is great for self-study
- **Tae Kim's** is great for solidifying grammar itself
- **Pimsleur** was good for getting a handle on the sound of the language

#### Present

- I am _1 guru_ away from "finishing" **wanikani** (level 60 + all gurus)
- I've been exposed to all of **BunPro** N2 now, but I still need some time to
  digest and master
- I've been enjoying my **podcasts**
  - _Lazy Fluency_ and _The Konnichiwa Podcast_ are great resources
  - The _Tofugu Podcast_ was great, but they haven't put anything out in a long
    time
  - _Learn Japanese with Noriko_ and _YuYuの日本語Podcast_ are also also worth
    mentioning
- **Anki** NX decks are always great
  - I've been utilizing the takoboto -> anki pipeline
- **Manga** is also a great resource
  - _よつばと!_ is **very**, **very** good
  - _フリエレン_ is **very**, **very** good

#### Future

- o.O who knows!
- Certainly more **anki**!
- I really want to read the _てんすら_ **light novels**

## Fitness

Not everything is a loss; I had three "hard" goals for fitness in 2024:

- Run a 10k
- Get my 5k time below 25:00
- Get my 1mi time below 7:00

I had largely plateaued by the end of 2023, but I've recently started to really
push and level up. After realizing that 10ks aren't really that bad at a slower
pace, I've started pushing my distances on Saturday mornings. By now, I'm
running >8mi each Saturday.

My 5k time had failed to progress past 26:00, but I was able to really start
pushing over the past few weeks. Since, I've been able to run 3 sub-24:00 times.
Similarly, I've been able to push 2 sub-7:00 runs on the treadmill.

Having met these goals in some form, I need to make sure I can continue to meet
them and re-evaluate what I plan to achieve by the end of the year.

## Theming

While I still like Nord, I've been desiring a theme with colors that "pop" more
than 20 different shades of blue /s. After some research into popular themes,
I've eventually settled on _Catppuccin Macchiato_. I've really enjoyed the vast
corpus of pre-configured application themes.

There's something about ricing your setup that really gets the gears moving for
wanting to work on other projects. Now that I have a little bit more time, I'm
beginning to start executing on a few ideas I've been putting off...

## Home Server

I just built my first home server. I have the setup planned in phases:

1. Build and set up the server
2. Set up nginx and domain forwarding
3. Set up core services:
   - gitea
   - syncthing
   - mealie _(okay, not really core, but something I really want)_
4. Set up the rest of the services

So far, I'm really pleased. Installing Ubuntu server was a breeze (I'll use nix
and podman to run any necessary services) and everything sort-of just works. Not
complaints.
