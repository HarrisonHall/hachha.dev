I've been in a slow-burn period of my life where I'm only able to slowly
chip away at my goals. Its been this way for about 2 years, and I think
it will continue for about another 3. While I understand this, sometimes
it does feel like I'm not making progress- especially when I see friends
and family go through major life events.

## Productivity
I've been trying to switch things up, for various reasons. Earlier this
year I began to streamline my pc experience with a few major setup changes:
arch->nixos, desktop->laptop, emacs->helix, dwm->sway, etc. I'm satisfied
with most of these changes, but I pushed off making other necessary changes
until now.

### Notes
I've always wanted a note taking system that respected the connection between
ideas. I tried writing this myself in university, but eventually settled on a
system utilizing org-mode in a git repo. For a few reasons I've basically
abandoned org-mode and returned to markdown: collaboration with others,
ditching Emacs, etc. I don't take digital notes for any math-heavy classes, so
I've basically been digital-note free since undergrad. Still, I've been wanting
to go back to journaling and keeping better notes on life events and other
explorations.

I pretty much concluded that I wanted a system where I could: take synchronized
notes anywhere (desktop/mobile), have browser support, see/auto-generate
connections between notes, ... At one or two points I even white-boarded out a few
extensions to markdown I might write to have my own simple multimedia support.
I had heard of a product called "Obsidian" that was all the news, but I refused to
use something proprietary. Oh silly me. After actually investigating Obsidian I
realized that _not only_ did it fit all of my requirements, but it also: extended
markdown in incredibly sensible ways, had insane community support, and is
self-funded. I haven't looked back.

I've also recently come across the concept of "bullet-journaling." I found this
interesting because it is almost exactly like the system I already use for daily
notes and todo tracking. I carry a Field Notes book around with me (at least to
work and other extended trips) so I can keep track of things I've done (special
events, vacations, etc.) and things I want/need to do but can't currently (chores,
hw, projects, things-to-google, etc.). This system works great and a single notebook
can last a few months (where a I use a single sheet for a single week). I usually
allocate other pages if I have any other big project ideas I want to explore.
I usually start the journal with a pseudo-toc which tracks any special pages/events
that occurred while using it. I store my older notes in a vans shoe box and it is
nostalgic to go back and look through it every few months.

### News
Two of my most used services, Twitter and Reddit, have both been going downhill
over the past few years. I've been meaning to jump ship, but it is very hard. 

I've been supportive of mastodon for years, but it wasn't until a great twitter
exodus this past year that it became viable. I've almost stopped using twitter
since it has become so bad: constant ads, ads that are "not family friendly,"
the negativity that's typically associated with twitter itself, and the
absolutely terrible promotion of tweets from people/organizations I don't
follow. I still don't think all of my twitter interests are fully present on
mastodon (indie game dev, Japanese learning content, ...), but I'm looking
forward to using the platform more in the future.

I've always used the Reddit mobile web version for 90% of my lurking. Sadly,
Reddit continues to make this version worse and worse. Reddit has slowly taken
away features, blocked content behind logins, and made the experience worse.
The subreddits that populate r/all and r/popular are also become less and less
relevant to me. Tabs are a great feature, and removing easy access to the rest
of the web by forcing Reddit into an app is silly. Lemmy briefly seemed like a
great alternative during the Reddit protests, but the communities just aren't
there.

I've decided to go back to RSS for most of my news. I have found some great
feeds which I may write about later. I keep track of my feeds manually using
the free app feeder, and any content that I want to save I simply share to
pocket for note-taking/bookmarking at a later time. No service necessary (other
than a free pocket account), but I am looking forward to self hosting my own
"pocket" (shiori/wallabag) and may consider using a service that one-ups this
process (feedly/readwise).

I'd love to do the same with YouTube, but I just don't see a viable alternative
for 90% of the YouTube content I subscribe to. Maybe peertube will be there one
day. I support other platforms in spirit (e.g. nebula, floatplane, etc.) but
I'm unwilling to pay for anything I don't really have time to use.

### Other
It's no secret that google search has progressively gotten worse. savannahXYZ
made a great [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrFv1O4dbqY) about the
problem. I've used DDG as my "main" engine for the past few years, and I relied
on it for most non-technical searches. Still, both engines are ad-based and DDG
can't help its "SEO-optimized" result ordering due to it essentially be a wrapper
for Bing.  

Hackernews has been very vocally supporting the engine Kagi. Kagi has a steep
pricing model, but it becomes _very_ obvious after a few technical searches how
great Kagi results actually are. 

## Health
I've been on a health "journey" the past 2 years. 2022 was the year of diet.
2023 is the year of running. I have plans for 2024, but we'll see where that goes.

My 2023 motivations have been towards running. I've started doing 5Ks:
I've been attempting 2/week on the treadmill and 1/month in a competition.
I can get sub-30 minute times consistently, but it is _still hard work_.
I'm going to continue to try and get better at cardio, but I've recently decided
on another long-term fitness goal.

## N3
I've been learning Japanese pretty consistently for the past 3 years,
but it will be another 3 before I will be able to consider myself "any good."
Its nice to look back every few months and see my progress. I'm registered for
the N3 in December and I can't wait to finally put my skills to the test.

It's hard to stay motivated with hobbies that are ultimately *just work*, but
I've found that habitualizing it really helps. I typically do WaniKani reviews
in the morning and evening (almost level 50 at time of writing), new
vocabulary/kanji at lunch, podcasts at the gym, BunPro before bed (25%
through N2 at time of writing), Anki whenever I have time, and any other
reading after BunPro but before I sleep. When written out, it is *a lot*
of work, but I'm pretty used to it by now. The only part of the N3 I'm really
worried about being short on by December is vocabulary (and maybe a little bit
of listening), but I'm not really worried about failing. The JLPT is really
just a way of external motivation and measuring progress.

## Services and Self-Hosting
Like most people, I pay for **too** many services. I'm pretty aware of the
services I pay for and actually use, but I still think I should slim it down.
If I actually *use* the service (and its actually a service, I'm not going
to pay a monthly fee for a product I "own!"), then I have no problem paying
for it (especially if the provider is a "small" company). Since I host my own
website, I think it may be time to start hosting some of my own services.
